docs: major README overhaul - performance-first, feature-focused design

This commit completely restructures the README to better showcase
ServerlessLLM's technical innovations and unique value proposition.

Key Changes:
- Performance metrics moved to top with benchmark chart placeholder
- Demo GIF section added for visual proof
- News section removed (prevents staleness)
- Features merged with examples (docs + code in one place)
- Fine-tuning elevated to core innovation (vs competitors)
- System architecture uses real diagram instead of ASCII art
- Comparison table removed (avoid conflicts)
- Research section simplified to citation only
- Community description made more stable ("maintained by" vs "research-driven")

Technical Improvements:
- Added 5 badges (PyPI, Downloads, Discord, WeChat, License)
- Explicit sllm-store install step added
- Store server start command separated for copy-paste
- Each feature now links to relevant docs
- Model names kept but performance numbers as TBD placeholders

sllm_store/README.md:
- Simplified to essentials with performance numbers
- Points to main README for full documentation
- Standalone users can still use it directly

New Documentation:
- DEPLOY_README_NOW.md - Deployment checklist and quick reference
- README_IMPROVEMENTS_TODO.md - Prioritized future improvements
- docs/images/IMAGE_SPECIFICATIONS.md - Specs for benchmark chart and demo GIF

Impact:
- Clearer value proposition (10x faster loading)
- Better positioning vs alternatives (unique features highlighted)
- Reduced friction (Docker-first quick start)
- Professional appearance (badges, architecture diagram)
- Scalable structure (won't look stale over time)

Next Steps:
1. Update Discord server ID in badge (see README line 16)
2. Create and upload benchmark_loading_speed.png
3. Record and upload demo_quickstart.gif
