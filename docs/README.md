## How to build ServelessLLM Docs

This website is built using Docusaurus, a modern static website generator.

### Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, use the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

### Local Development

To start a local development server and open up a browser window, use the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```

Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

To generate static content into the build directory, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory, which can be served using any static content hosting service.
