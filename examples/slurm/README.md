# SLURM-based HPC Cluster Setup Guide
This guide will help you deploy ServerlessLLM on a SLURM-based HPC (High Performance Computing) cluster. Please make sure you have installed the ServerlessLLM following the [installation guide](https://serverlessllm.github.io/docs/stable/getting_started/installation#installing-with-pip) on all machines.
## Some Tips about Installation
- **Both installation and build require an internet connection**. please make sure the port 443 on the node you want to install is accessible.
- We recommend using [installing with pip](https://serverlessllm.github.io/docs/stable/getting_started/installation#installing-with-pip) if there is no CUDA driver on the node you want to install.
If you want to [install from source](https://serverlessllm.github.io/docs/stable/getting_started/installation#installing-from-source), please make sure CUDA driver available on the node you want to install.
Here are some commands to check it.
```shell
module avail cuda # if you can see some CUDA options, it means CUDA is available, then load the cuda module
module load cuda-12.x # load specific CUDA version
# or
nvidia-smi # if you can see the GPU information, it means CUDA is available
# or
which nvcc # if you can see the CUDA compiler's path, it means CUDA is available
```
However, we **strongly recommend that you read the documentation for the HPC you are using** to find out how to check if the CUDA driver is available.

## Job Nodes Assignment for Head, Worker, Store and Serve
Let's start a head on the main job node (```JobNode01```) and add the worker on other job node (```JobNode02```). The head and the worker should be on different job nodes to avoid resource contention. The ```sllm-store-server``` should be started on the job node that runs worker (```JobNode02```), for passing the model weights, and the ```sllm-serve``` should be started on the main job node (```JobNode01```), finally you can use ```sllm-cli``` to manage the models on the login node.

Note: ```JobNode02``` requires GPU, but ```JobNode01``` does not.
- **Head**: JobNode01
- **Worker**: JobNode02
- **sllm-store-server**: JobNode02
- **sllm-serve**: JobNode01
- **sllm-cli**: Login Node

## Step 1: Start the Head Node
1. **Activate the ``sllm`` environment and start the head node.**

   Here is the example script, named start_head_node.sh.
    ```shell
    #!/bin/bash
    #SBATCH --partition=your_partition # specify the partition you want to use
    #SBATCH --job-name=sllm-head
    #SBATCH --output=sllm_head.out
    #SBATCH --error=sllm_head.err
    #SBATCH --nodes=1
    #SBATCH --ntasks=1
    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=12
    #SBATCH --gpus-per-task=0

    cd /path/to/ServerlessLLM

    conda activate sllm

    ray start --head --port=6379 --num-cpus=12 --num-gpus=0 \
    --resources='{"control_node": 1}' --block
    ```
   - Read the HPC's documentation to find out which partition you can use. Replace ```your_partition``` in the script with that partition name.
   - Replace ```/path/to/ServerlessLLM``` with the path to the ServerlessLLM installation directory.

2. **Find an idle node**

    Use ```sinfo -p your_partition``` to find some idle nodes. For example:
    ```
   $ sinfo -p compute
   PARTITION AVAIL  NODES  STATE  TIMELIMIT  NODELIST
   compute    up       10  idle   infinite   compute[01-10]
   compute    up        5  alloc  infinite   compute[11-15]
   compute    up        2  down   infinite   compute[16-17]
    ```
3. **Submit the script**

    Use ```sbatch --nodelist=JobNode01 start_head_node.sh``` to submit the script to certain idle node (here we assume it is ```JobNode01```).

4. **Expected output**

   In ```sllm_head.out```, you will see the following output:
   ```shell
   Local node IP: xxx.xxx.xx.xx
   --------------------
   Ray runtime started.
   --------------------
   ```
   Remember the IP address, denoted ```<HEAD_NODE_IP>```, you will need it in following steps.

## Step 2: Start the Worker Node & Store
We will start the worker node and store in the same script. Because the server loads the model weights onto the GPU and uses shared GPU memory to pass the pointer to the client. If you submit another script with ```#SBATCH --gpres=gpu:1```, it will be possibly set to use a different GPU, as specified by different ```CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES``` settings. Thus, they cannot pass the model weights.
1. **Activate the ```sllm-worker``` environment and start the worker node.**

   Here is the example script, named```start_worker_node_store.sh```.
   ```shell
   #!/bin/sh
   #SBATCH --partition=your_partition
   #SBATCH --job-name=sllm-worker-store
   #SBATCH --output=sllm_worker_store.out
   #SBATCH --error=sllm_worker_store.err
   #SBATCH --gres=gpu:2                   # Request 2 GPUs
   #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4              # Request 4 CPU cores
   #SBATCH --mem=16G                      # Request 16GB of RAM

   cd /path/to/ServerlessLLM

   conda activate sllm-worker

   HEAD_NODE_IP=<HEAD_NODE_IP>

   export CUDA_HOME=/opt/cuda-12.5.0 # replace with your CUDA path
   export PATH=$CUDA_HOME/bin:$PATH
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CUDA_HOME/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

   ray start --address=$HEAD_NODE_IP:6379 --num-cpus=4 --num-gpus=2 \
   --resources='{"worker_node": 1, "worker_id_0": 1}' --block &

   sllm-store-server &

   wait
   ```
   - Read the HPC's documentation to find out which partition you can use. Replace ```your_partition``` in the script with that partition name.
   - Replace ```/path/to/ServerlessLLM``` with the path to the ServerlessLLM installation directory.
   - Replace ```<HEAD_NODE_IP>``` with the IP address of the head node.
   - Replace ```/opt/cuda-12.5.0``` with the path to your CUDA path.
2. **Find the CUDA path**
   - Some slurm-based HPCs have a module system, you can use ```module avail cuda``` to find the CUDA module.
   - If it does not work, read the HPC's documentation carefully to find the CUDA path. For example, my doc said CUDA is in ```\opt```. Then you can use ```srun``` command to start an interactive session on the node, such as ```srun --pty -t 00:30:00 -p your_partition --gres=gpu:1 /bin/bash```. A pseudo-terminal will be started for you to find the path.
   - Find it and replace ```/opt/cuda-12.5.0``` with the path to your CUDA path.
3. **Submit the script on the other node**

    Use ```sbatch --nodelist=JobNode02 start_worker_node.sh``` to submit the script to certain idle node (here we assume it is ```JobNode02```). In addition, We recommend that you place the head and worker on different nodes so that the Serve can start smoothly later, rather than queuing up for resource allocation.
4. **Expected output**

   In ```sllm_worker_store.out```, you will see the following output:

   - The worker node expected output:
      ```shell
       Local node IP: xxx.xxx.xx.xx
       --------------------
       Ray runtime started.
       --------------------
      ```
   - The store expected output:
      ```shell
      I20241030 11:52:54.719007 1321560 checkpoint_store.cpp:41] Number of GPUs: 1
      I20241030 11:52:54.773468 1321560 checkpoint_store.cpp:43] I/O threads: 4, chunk size: 32MB
      I20241030 11:52:54.773548 1321560 checkpoint_store.cpp:45] Storage path: "./models/"
      I20241030 11:52:55.060559 1321560 checkpoint_store.cpp:71] GPU 0 UUID: 52b01995-4fa9-c8c3-a2f2-a1fda7e46cb2
      I20241030 11:52:55.060798 1321560 pinned_memory_pool.cpp:29] Creating PinnedMemoryPool with 128 buffers of 33554432 bytes
      I20241030 11:52:57.258795 1321560 checkpoint_store.cpp:83] Memory pool created with 4GB
      I20241030 11:52:57.262835 1321560 server.cpp:306] Server listening on 0.0.0.0:8073
      ```

## Step 3: Start the Serve on the Head Node
1. **Check if port 8343 can be accessed**

   - Some HPCs have a firewall that blocks port 8343. You can use ```nc -zv <HEAD_NODE_IP> 8343``` to check if the port is accessible.
   - If it is not accessible, find an available port and replace ```available_port``` in the following script.
2. **Activate the ```sllm``` environment and start the serve.**

   Here is the example script, named```start_serve.sh```.
   ```shell
   #!/bin/sh
   #SBATCH --partition=your_partition
   #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4              # Request 4 CPU cores
   #SBATCH --mem=16G                      # Request 16GB of RAM
   #SBATCH --output=serve.log

   cd /path/to/ServerlessLLM

   conda activate sllm

   sllm-serve start --host <HEAD_NODE_IP>
   # sllm-serve start --host <HEAD_NODE_IP> --port <AVAIL_PORT> # if you have changed the port
   ```
   - Replace ```your_partition``` in the script as before.
   - Replace ```/path/to/ServerlessLLM``` as before.
3. **Submit the script on the head node**

    Use ```sbatch --nodelist=JobNode01 start_serve.sh``` to submit the script to the head node (```JobNode01```).

4. **Expected output**
   ```shell
   -- Connecting to existing Ray cluster at address: xxx.xxx.xx.xx:6379...
   -- Connected to Ray cluster.
   INFO:     Started server process [1339357]
   INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
   INFO:     Application startup complete.
   INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://xxx.xxx.xx.xx:8343 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
   ```
## Step 4: Use ```sllm-cli``` to manage models
1. **You can do this step on login node, and set the ```LLM_SERVER_URL``` environment variable:**
   ```shell
   $ conda activate sllm
   (sllm)$ export LLM_SERVER_URL=http://<HEAD_NODE_IP>:8343/
   ```
   - Replace ```<HEAD_NODE_IP>``` with the actual IP address of the head node.
   - Replace ```8343``` with the actual port number if you have changed it.
2. **Deploy a Model Using ```sllm-cli```**
   ```shell
   (sllm)$ sllm-cli deploy --model facebook/opt-1.3b
   ```
## Step 5: Query the Model Using OpenAI API Client
   **You can use the following command to query the model:**
   ```shell
   curl http://<HEAD_NODE_IP>:8343/v1/chat/completions \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{
         "model": "facebook/opt-1.3b",
         "messages": [
               {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
               {"role": "user", "content": "What is your name?"}
         ]
      }'
   ```
   - Replace ```<HEAD_NODE_IP>``` with the actual IP address of the head node.
   - Replace ```8343``` with the actual port number if you have changed it.

## Step 6: Stop Jobs
On the SLURM cluster, we usually use the ```scancel``` command to stop the job. Firstly, list all jobs you have submitted (replace ```your_username``` with your username):
```shell
$ squeue -u your_username
JOBID    PARTITION     NAME                USER       ST  TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
  1234    compute   sllm-head         your_username  R   0:01      1    JobNode01
  1235    compute   sllm-worker-store your_username  R   0:01      1    JobNode02
  1236    compute   sllm-serve        your_username  R   0:01      1    JobNode01
```
Then, use ```scancel``` to stop the job (```1234```, ```1235``` and ```1236``` are JOBIDs):
```shell
$ scancel 1234 1235 1236
```
