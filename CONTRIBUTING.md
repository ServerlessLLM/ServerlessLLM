## Code of Conduct

We expect all contributors to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ServerlessLLM/ServerlessLLM/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Be respectful, inclusive, and open to feedback.

## How to Contribute

- Check the [public development board](https://github.com/orgs/ServerlessLLM/projects/2) for tasks (i.e., items with the status `Ready ðŸŸ¢`) or [issue tracker](https://github.com/ServerlessLLM/ServerlessLLM/issues) for open issues. You can also create a new one to discuss your idea.
- Follow the [Fork-and-Pull-Request](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) workflow when opening your pull requests.
- Ensure your code follows our style guidelines and passes all tests (see [Development Environment](#development-environment)).
- Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes.
  - The pull request title should follow the [Commit Message Guidelines](#commit-message-guidelines).
  - The description should follow the [Pull Request Template](https://github.com/ServerlessLLM/ServerlessLLM/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).
  - Make sure to mention any related issues.

Before your pull request can be merged, it must pass the formatting, linting, and testing checks (see [Development Environment](#development-environment)).

If you fix a bug:
- Add a relevant unit test when possible. These can be found in the `test` directory.
If you make an improvement:
- Update any affected example console scripts in the `examples` directory and documentation in the `docs` directory.
- Update unit tests when relevant.
If you add a feature:
- Include unit tests in the `test` directory.
- Add a demo script in the `examples` directory.

### Roadmap and Tasks

You can find available tasks (i.e., `status=Ready ðŸŸ¢`) and contribute to planned features by checking our [public development board](https://github.com/orgs/ServerlessLLM/projects/2).
For beginners, we recommend starting with issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`.
Feel free to discuss any ideas before getting started!

### Development Environment

Ensure your development environment is set up with the following tools:

- Format your code with pre-commit hooks:
```bash
pip install -r requirements-lint.txt

# add lint hooks to git commit
pre-commit install --install-hooks
```

This will automatically format your code before committing. However, you can also run the following commands manually:
```bash
# format code
pre-commit run -a
```

- (Recommended) Sign off your commits:
```bash
git commit -s -m "feat: add new feature"
```

### Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the commit format rule based on the [Angular Commit Format](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-format). This format improves readability and helps generate changelogs automatically.

#### Commit Message Structure

Each commit message should consist of a **header** and a **body**:

```
<type>: <summary>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>(optional)
<BLANK LINE>
```
- **Type**: Choose from `build`, `ci`, `docs`, `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`.
- **Summary**: A brief description of the change.
- **Body**: Mandatory for all commits except those of type "docs". Must be at least 20 characters long.


Examples:

```
feat: add logging in sllm worker
```

```
docs: add new example for serving vision model

Vision mode: xxx
Implemented xxx in `xxx.py`
```
